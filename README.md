# WASP - Wi-Fi Active Sensing Platform

ðŸš§ **This board is currently under active development** ðŸš§

Hey! this is actually my **first** custom PCB project about Wi-Fi sensing, where Iâ€™m trying to build an 8-node CSI receiver using ESP32 microcontrollers. The idea is to get WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple ESP32s _at the same time_ so I can try doing stuff like angle of arrival (AoA), localization, human detection, or even gestures detection! (yes, WiFi can actually do that).

If youâ€™re not familiar with this kind of thing â€” Iâ€™m basically building a **WiFi sensing platform**, where you can actually **sense the environment using WiFi signals**. This technique uses CSI (Channel State Information) to capture how wireless signals bounce, reflect, and change around objects, which can tell you a lot â€” like where someone is, if they're moving, or even their gestures.

This board lets 8 ESP32s work together in sync to capture the wireless channel with really high timing accuracy. I'm still working on it, and I hope I can really complete this project!
